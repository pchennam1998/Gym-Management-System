# Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values

# Communication 

Our team's main goal was to keep everyone updated with the work and communication is a key part of it. We held scrum meeting every Friday and Tuesday to discuss our progress. Two meetings were necessary as we could decide the task for the next week and another meeting mid week to see our progress so that we are all in sync and if there are any issues for any team member we need to take care of it immediately. To keep track of our project we used the Git Task Board.

# Courage

Courage was a crucial part of our development process. All of us were not very confident of our expertise in the technology stack, hence to keep up with the progress for every sprint and not fearing to ask for help or more time if required was necessary. It takes courage to take up daunting work and we were definitely very courageous throughout our process.

# Simplicity

It is always good to keep the work simple, that way if any one else from the team has to take up the work it will not comsume much time. We used code refactoring techniques to keep our code clean of any duplications and efficient to run. As there were multiple API and UI changes simplicity was a cruicial part for development of this project.

# Feedback

It is necessary to take group feedback in any project. This helps the developer know how well he has progressed and in what ways can he make the work he has done better. Hence we used Feedback extensively throughout our project. We tried to adhere to the timeline and complete the work required by us to do in the sprint.
